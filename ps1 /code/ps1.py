# Task 1.6
def mnc_tree_search(m, c):
    '''
    Solution should be the action taken from the root node (initial state) to 
    the leaf node (goal state) in the search tree.

    Parameters
    ----------    
    m: no. of missionaries
    c: no. of cannibals
    
    Returns
    ----------    
    Returns the solution to the problem as a tuple of steps. Each step is a tuple of two numbers x and y, indicating the number of missionaries and cannibals on the boat respectively as the boat moves from one side of the river to another. If there is no solution, return False.
